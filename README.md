# Classification-of-images-with-pre-trained-Resenet-model

Classification of images using  ResNets architecture in Google colab environment

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained ResNets model to classify images. 
The project uses PyTorch library and the ResNets architecture, which is a deep convolutional
neural network model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various image classification tasks.
Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

    Python 3.x
    PyTorch
    Torchvision
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    
    You can install these dependencies by running the following command:
    pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib

What the project does?

The aim of this project is to classify images using a pre-trained model and using 1000 ImageNet classes.

1000 imagenet class files can be accessed from the following address:

â€¢	Why the project is useful?

This project is based on a trained model with optimized weights.
 In general, deep learning models provide acceptable results for image processing projects.
 The noteworthy point of this project is the use of a personal dataset whose images have been downloaded from Google.
